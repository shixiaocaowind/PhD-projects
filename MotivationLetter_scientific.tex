\maketitle

I have accomplished many specialized courses as well as a few scientific projects during the research work of my PhD thesis in Technische Universit\"{a}t Wien, which mainly focus on the electron transport. \\

With the background of Electron Transport, Theoretical Chemistry and Solid State Physics, I would like to continue my contributions to science. During the PhD project, I am mainly working on the  destructive quantum interference and electron hopping through branched molecules. With my background of theoretical chemistry and solid state physics, I am experienced in DFT based electronic structure simulations using the atomic simulation environment (ASE) and GPAW code (both developed by the group at DTU in Denmark).\\

Previous work have cultivated my interest in transport properties, surface structure of solid.
Now I am correcting my thesis for my PhD project \textacutedbl Electrochemical Interference  \textgravedbl within 1 month. I have a strong interest in scientific career and I am very interested in the research directions of circuit simulation and coding. \\

I would like to stay in Austria in the following few years, therefore I would sincerely welcome an opportunity to join your group.
