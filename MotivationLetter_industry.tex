\maketitle

I have accomplished many specialized courses as well as a few scientific projects during the research work of my PhD thesis in Technische Universit\"{a}t Wien, which mainly focus on the electron transport. \\

With the background of Electron Transport, Theoretical Chemistry and Solid State Physics, I have a strong interest to bridge what I have acquired in the scientific career and practice in industry. Programming and data analysis are of my interests, hence I am self-learning numerical algorithm as well as machine learning, meanwhile I keep learning German. \\

I like the people here and have good friends around, I would like to stay in Austria, therefore I would sincerely welcome an opportunity to join your company and grow while doing the work since I am fast in learning new things.
